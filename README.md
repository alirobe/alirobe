# Ali Robertson

G'day. 👦🏽

I'm an Aussie system architect and consulting tech strategist.

I like to help organisations find a clear path through their information management & software development journeys.

I have a background in Microsoft tech - including Azure, MS 365, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform; and some community engagemnet in these areas.

I also have some experience designing and leading commercial software development projects.
